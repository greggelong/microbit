## ultrasonic sensor

I have rewritten the the script using only micropython and microbit library.
follwing the tutorial at # tinybit ultrasonic using firialabs.com/blogs

connection:
bread board and clips board with sound
I have also rewired the breakout board using the pin map

I am trigering with pin 2 and getting the echo with pin 1
Then using pin0 for sound

using the breadboad and breakout board to connect
